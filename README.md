This is an interactive tool to simulate and visualize different sorting algorithms, such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort. 

The program allows users to choose an algorithm and sort a list of integers. It can also be used to understand how the algorithms work through test cases.

- Implements Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms.
- Allows interactive input for sorting.
- Includes test cases to verify correctness.
